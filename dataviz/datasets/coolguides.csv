Agnes Baden-Powell,https://infoscout.cl/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/pic335.jpg,"**Agnes Baden-Powell** (1858-1945) was the younger sister of Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scout Movement. Following negative publicity concerning the presence of girls at Scout events, Agnes created the **Girl Guides Association** (named after the Corps of Guides, a regiment in the British Indian Army). As president, she wrote the first Guide handbook, //The Handbook for Girl Guides or How Girls Can Help to Build Up the Empire//. Following pressure, she resigned from the presidency in favour of Princess Mary, but remained vice-president until her death."
Alice Manfield,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Alice_Manfield_-_Guide_Alice%2C_Mt_Buffalo%2C_c1900-30%2C_SLV.jpg,"**Alice Manfield** (1878-1960), commonly known as **Guide Alice**, was a mountain guide, naturalist and early feminist who led tourist treks starting in the 1890s on the Mogullumbidj land of Mount Buffalo in Australia. She was known for her plucky personality and controversial 'trouser suit', which she designed herself, pioneering outdoor wear for women. She ran a chalet on the Buffalo plateau, working through bushfires, storms and 8 feet of snow (during which the chalet had to be entered via the chimney). Her fame helped lead to the establishment of the Mount Buffalo National Park."
Salty and Roselle,https://www.todayifoundout.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/salty-and-roselle.jpg,"**Salty** (1996-2008) and **Roselle** (1998-2011) were two guide dogs who were with their owners in the World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks in New York City. They each guided their owners out of the burning towers before the buildings collapsed, calmly leading them down more than 70 flights of stairs. In 2002 they received the international Dickin Medal for animals that have displayed ""//conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty//"", alongside a 9/11 search and rescue dog named Apollo."
The Negro Motorist Green Book,https://digital.tcl.sc.edu/digital/api/singleitem/image/greenbook/0/default.jpg,"The **Negro Motorist Green Book** was a guidebook for African American roadtrippers, founded by Victor Hugo Green and published annually from 1936 to 1966. Published during the Jim Crow era, when open and often legally prescribed discrimination against African Americans was widespread, it helped Black motorists avoid harassment, physical violence, or even murder for minor infractions or for being in predominantly white areas."
The Chicago Manual of Style,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KxE0fV7QL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg","The **Chicago Manual of Style** (or **CMOS**, pronounced like “sea moss”) is a style guide for American English published since 1906 by the University of Chicago Press. Its guidelines for publishing, style and usage, and citations and indexes—known as “Chicago style” rules and recommendations—are among the most widely used in the United States, especially in academic and book publishing."
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2013/03/11/10/douglas-adams-google-doodle-110313_1.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,"The **Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy** is a wholly remarkable book – perhaps the most remarkable, certainly the most successful book ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor. More popular than the //Celestial Homecare Omnibus//, better selling than //53 Things to Do in Zero Gravity//, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of philosophical blockbusters – //Where God Went Wrong//, //Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes//, and //Who is This God Person Anyway?//"
