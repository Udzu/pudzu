1947,bit,"A portmanteau of //binary digit//. Attributed to **John W. Tukey** by **Claude Shannon**, who used it in his seminal 1948 paper //A Mathematical Theory of Communication//."
1956,byte,"Coined by **Werner Buchholz** while designing the IBM Stretch. Originally referred to the number of bits used to encode a character (which for the Stretch was variable), now usually to 8 bits. A deliberate respelling of //bite// to avoid accidental mutation to //bit//."
1958,software,"Coined by analogy to //hardware//. First published by **John W. Tukey**. A slightly earlier usage by **Richard R. Carhart** seems to refer to users, not programs."
196?,default,"Originally meant a failure, like in //default on a loan// or //win by default//. In the 1960s it was applied to preselected settings that were chosen ""in default of"" an explicit value."
1965,hyperlink,"Coined by **Ted Nelson**, alongside //hypertext// and //hypermedia//. //Hyper-// is used here in the mathematical sense of extension and generality, as in //hypercube//."
1965,mouse,"First applied to the pointing device by ARC employee **Bill English**, due to its physical similarity to the rodent (with the cord resembling the tail). The term may have also been influenced by the fact that the screen cursor at the time was called 'CAT'."
1968,metadata,"Coined by **Philip Bagley** by analogy to //metalanguage//. Successfully trademarked in 1986 by **Jack Myers**' //The Metadata Company//, who claimed to have coined it in 1969."
197?,(re)boot,"Shortening of 1950s //bootstrap//, referring to the use of ""a fixed sequence of instructions to initiate the loading of further instructions and ultimately of a complete program"". Based on the idea of //pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps//."
1973,ethernet,"Named by **Robert Metcalfe** after the //luminiferous aether// once postulated to exist as an ""omnipresent, completely-passive medium for the propagation of electromagnetic waves"" (or in this case, data packets)."
1976,meme,"Coined by **Richard Dawkins** in //The Selfish Gene//, modeled on //gene// from the Ancient Greek μίμημα ('imitated thing'). Applied to Internet memes by **Mike Godwin** in 1993."
1982,cyberspace,"Blend of //cybernetics// and //space//. Coined by **William Gibson** in his short story collection //Burning Chrome// and popularized in his 1984 novel //Neuromancer//. Cybernetics (the study of communication and control) is actually cybern+etics not cyber+netics."
1983,virus,"Applied to self-reproducing programs in a paper by **Fred Cohen**, who attributed the term to his mentor **Leonard Adelman** (the A in RSA). //Malware// is from the 1990s."
1985,avatar,"Based on the Sanskrit word for the descent of deity into terrestrial from. Its use for the graphical representation of a user was invented by **Richard Garriott** for //Ultima IV//, adopted by **Chip Morningstar** for the MMORPG //Habitat// in 1986, and popularised by **Neil Stephenson**'s //Snow Crash// in 1992."
1987,gif,"Acronym of //Graphics Interchange Format// originally referring to a lossless image and video format developed by **Steve Wilhite** at CompuServe and originally pronounced with a j. Now often pronounced with a g and used to refer to any short, looping video."
1989,web,"Named by its inventor **Tim Berners-Lee**, who also considered calling it //The Information Mesh// or //The Information Mine// (TIM). Web suggests a decentralized structure of links."
1989,zip,"The association with file compression comes from **Phil Katz**'s //PKZIP// tool. The name was suggested by his friend **Robert Mahoney** to suggest high speed, though its transition to a verb may have also been aided by its zipper meaning."
199?,ping,"The modern meaning of sending a brief message derives from the 1982 //ping// software utility, which checked whether a target computer was online, and which was named by its author **Mike Muuss** after the sound of sonar."
1993,cloud,"Popularised by information systems professor **Ramnath Chellappa** in 1997, but previously used by both Apple spin-off **General Magic** and **Compaq**. The term is predated by the use of cloud symbols to denote networks in communication diagrams."
1993,spam,"First used on USENET by **Joel Furr**, but previously used to describe disruptive activity in MUD games. The usage derives from the 1970 Monty Python SPAM sketch (in particular, the overwhelming Viking chorus). SPAM itself was named by **Ken Daigneau** in 1937 in a competition and is thought to derive from //spiced ham//."
1994,cookie,"Browser use was coined by **Lou Montulli**, based on the earlier term //magic cookie// (a short packet of data passed between programs), which in turn derives from //fortune cookie// (a cookie with an embedded message)."
1995,wiki,"Coined by **Ward Cunningham**, who named //WikiWikiWeb//, the first wiki, after the //Wiki Wiki Shuttle// service at Honolulu Airport. //Wiki// in Hawaiian means //quick//."

1997,emoji,"From the Japanese word for //pictograph// (from //e// 'picture' + //moji// 'character'). The resemblance to //emoticon// (a late 80s coining, from //emotion//+//icon//) is purely coincidental."
1999,blog,"Rebracketing of //weblog// as we+blog by **Peter Merholz**. Weblog itself was coined in 1997 by **Jorn Barger**. //Vlog// is from 2002."
